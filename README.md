FAQs
1. Can I use these Capstone projects in my job interviews?

Yes! That's the point of these capstone projects. Unlike course projects with solution code and video walkthroughs, Capstone Projects are meant to be your "own work". There are over a million students who have enrolled in this web development course worldwide. If you add a course project to your portfolio, your client will likely know it's from this course. The capstone projects, on the other hand, have no solution code, no walk-through, and no design specs. It's purely your creation So it can be counted as your work and be added to your portfolio.

When I hire developers, I always ask for a portfolio. I consider what they have built by themselves to be far more important than which University they went to or if they have a computer science degree. Many of my friends who are CEOs in multinationals and startups agree.



2. What if I don't remember how to do something, even though I watched all the videos?

Watching a video is often not enough to learn a skill. That's why these capstone projects are a great opportunity to identify your weak points. While you're building, you'll find yourself stuck or forgetting how to do things. Great! It's then time to review previous lessons or online documentation to fill your knowledge gaps.
